## What is Crust?

Crust is a game development tool that allows users to create games using text-based programming, unlike Scratch, which is drag-and-drop based. Main features include but are not limited to:

- Text-based programming language
- A lot of functions from Scratch
- Runs at a smooth 60 FPS instead of 30 FPS in Scratch
- Supports all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) except mobile
- Open-source and free to use

code = "example.crst"
sounds = []
costumes = []
x = 0
y = 0
w = 1
h = 1
```

```
// example.crst
// This is a simple Crust program that draws a blue circle on the screen

setup {}

update {
    set_color(0, 0, 255) // Set color to blue
    circle(100, 100, 50) // Draw a circle at (100, 100) with a radius of 50
}
