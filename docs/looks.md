- `say(string, time)`: Makes the sprite say the specified string for the specified time in seconds. The string is displayed above the sprite.
- `say(string)`: Makes the sprite say the specified string indefinitely until another `say` or `think` block is called.
- `think(string, time)`: Makes the sprite think the specified string for the specified time in seconds. The string is displayed above the sprite. The text is 30% transparent.
- `think(string)`: Makes the sprite think the specified string indefinitely until another `say` or `think` block is called.
- `switch_costume(costume)`: Switches the sprite's costume to the specified costume. The costume is specified by its index in the sprite's costume list, starting from 0.

- `previous_backdrop()`: Switches the stage to the previous backdrop in the stage's backdrop list. If the stage is already on the first backdrop, it wraps around to the last backdrop.
- `change_scale(increment)`: Changes the sprite's scale by the specified increment. The scale is a percentage of the original size, where 100% is the original size.
- `set_scale(scale)`: Sets the sprite's scale to the specified value. The scale is a percentage of the original size, where 100% is the original size.
- `change_effect(effect, increment)`: Changes the specified effect by the specified increment
- `set_effect(effect, value)`: Sets the specified effect to the specified value.
- `clear_effects()`: Clears all effects applied to the sprite.
- `clear_effect(effect)`: Clears the specified effect applied to the sprite.
- `go_to_layer(layer)`: Moves the sprite to the specified layer.
- `go_by_layers("forward" | "backward", steps)`: Moves the sprite by the specified number of layers in the specified direction.

    - `"backward"`: Moves the sprite backward by the specified number of layers.

- `size()`: Returns the current size of the sprite.
- `scale()`: Returns the current scale modifier of the sprite.
- `bounds()`: Returns the bounds of the sprite as a list `[x, y, width, height]`, where `(x, y)` is the top-left corner of the sprite.
